                <h3>00. Challenging Transitions</h3>
                <p>Tempo was designed with the intent to ease the uncertainty that immigrants experience when searching for a new home in an unfamiliar city. It allows immigrants to explore their new home city and discover homes in neighbourhoods that suit their lifestyle needs.</p>

                <h3>01. Objective</h3>
                <p>Create an interactive digital experience that caters to a specific domain and context.</p>
                
                <p>I was the art director and interactive prototyper, with supporting roles in UX research and UI design. I was responsible for visually establishing trust + reliability, designing two major app features, and the content formatting of Tempo's onboarding quiz. In addition, I oversaw the development of all major workflows.</p>

                <h3>02. Insights</h3>
                <p>To start, my team and I conducted user interviews to gain insight to the experiences behind immigrating to Canada. We also conducted secondary research on existing programs, laws, and rental apps. I was responsible for looking into rental policies and laws, which can differ per city or province — ultimately helping to determine feasibility and scope.</p>

                <p>The information we gathered allowed us to create our persona, Tom:</p>

                    <img src="img/tempo/persona_tom.png" alt="Tom, typical user">
                    <figcaption>Tom seeks efficiency and on-the-go accessibility.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>User journey maps helped us to better understand where Tempo could improve current frictions in the house-seeking process — particularly in the areas of discovery and search.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>03. Final Outcome</h3>

                    <img src="img/tempo/tempo-onboard-v1_1x.png" alt="screenflow of Tempo's original onboarding">

                    <figcaption>Neighbourhood exploration / highlights key interest points in the area such as schools, grocery stores, and transit.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/tempo/tempo-compare_2x.png" alt="screenflow of comparing house listings in Tempo">
                    <figcaption>Comparing rental listings / after finding suitable neighbourhoods, comparing home-specific features helps Tom find the best place to stay.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>In prototyping, I prioritized straightforward interactions that required less back-and-forth between screens to promote clarity in a space saturated with information. Here, I provided feedback and suggestions to various members of the team to bring these interactions to life.</p>
                
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Tempo app introduction video.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>We were praised by the teaching team on how streamlined Tempo's functionality appeared, and on the uniqueness of the neighbourhood exploration feature.</p>

                <h3>04. Takeaways</h3>
                <p>For my first academic interaction design project, there was definitely a steep learning curve, especially with the context my team and I chose to design for. I was also learning prototyping tools on the go.</p>

                <p>I've also come to realize how much thought goes into designing information filtering for maps, and have a newfound appreciation for how seamless of an experience it can be.</p>
